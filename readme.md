install dependencies : `npm i`
To run the application, navigate to it's root folder and then : `node bin/www`
Go to browser, and browse for : `http://localhost:3000/`
If you are using port 3000 for any other application, then you can change this project's default port from `bin/www` file and then use that port number instead of 3000
